About
=====

This quadcopter was originally made for EESTEC Antwerp's workshop "AntwerPi 2.0" in end of June 2016. Hopefully it can find more usecases through this documentation.

The quad was built from scratch, and used rather common (and trustworthy) parts, with the exception of the Navio2 which is rather new in the world of DIY avionics. The combination of a Navio2 and a Raspberry Pi allows for a much greater flexibility than either a traditional DIY drone which lacks a proper way of programming it, or a commercial drone, which lacks an open API (like DJI's drones), or extensibility for sensors or networks (the RPi and Navio2 provide analog and digital (USB, UART, Ethernet) input).

Issues or TODO's about the drone can be found here: https://github.com/eestec-antwerp/AntwerPi2/issues.

===========================

  1. Learn a bit about our drone
     
     * See the :ref:`links` for a `presentation <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kae-PVtmXTqmM_sZVHGEoIb2vXHGXI42BfIvT4r4-KI/edit?usp=sharing>`_ given during the event (recommended!), along with other important documentation.
     * Optionally, a detailed list of the components in the drone can be found at :ref:`parts`.
  2. Learn how to program the drone it in :ref:`software`
     
     * Optionally, test your software in SITL.
  3. Learn how to add or modify hardware in :ref:`hardware`
  4. Learn how to prepare for a flight, and maintain the drone afterwards in :ref:`setup`
  5. Learn how to fly (in case you need to take over).
     
     * This is not covered by this documentation, but you can get the basics using `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6btEFJJD4_o>`_ and a cheap commercial quad (that can take a beating) to train with.
  6. Fly!

  
Apart from that, there's also a :ref:`glossary` to help you understand all the terms.
