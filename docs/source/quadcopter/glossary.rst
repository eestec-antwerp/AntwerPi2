    DF-13
        A kind of connector (for data/low power), with a varying amount of pins. Somewhat of a standard among drones. The Navio has a lot of them.
    XT60
        A connector for batteries, rated up to 60A.
    UART
        Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter: see http://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/37817
    I2C
        (Officially written as IÂ²C), Inter-Integrated Circuit: see http://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/37817
    SPI
        Serial Peripheral Interface: see http://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/37817
    ADC
        Analog-to-Digital Convertor. The data is the voltage.
    ESC
        Electronic Speed Controller
    LiPo
        Lithium-Polymer [battery]
    CW
        Clockwise
    CCW
        Counter clockwise
    C-rating
        A confusing way to rate batteries on max current, has nothing to do with Coulombs. See http://www.revolectrix.com/tech_data/lipoCalc/Battery_C_Rating.htm
    
        

Software
========

.. glossary::

    MAVLink
        Binary protocol over which all the :term:`DroneCode` related projects communicate.
    GCS
        Ground Control Station, eg. QGroundControl or Tower
    SITL
        Software in the loop
    APM
        ArduPilot Mega. Sometimes used to refer to the hardware, sometimes used to refer to the entire ArduPilot project (which is software).
    PX4
        An alternative Open Source flight stack, again often used to refer to the hardware running it (Pixhawk). Also speaks MAVLink.
