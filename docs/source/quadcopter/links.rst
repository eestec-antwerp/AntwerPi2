Documentation
=============

The internet is full of resources, but they can be rather overwhelming. Therefore, here is a collection of interesting resources:

  - `How to make a Drone <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kae-PVtmXTqmM_sZVHGEoIb2vXHGXI42BfIvT4r4-KI/edit?usp=sharing>`_: Presentation by Evert, given during the workshop. 54 slides.
  - `The Beginner's Guide to Multicopters <http://polakiumengineering.com/downloads/The_Beginner's_Guide_to_Multicopters_06292012.pdf>`_ (Polakium Engineering): pdf, 19 pages. Ignore all the stuff about flight controllers.
  - `Arducopter wiki <http://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html>`_: Contains some generic info about drones too.
  - `Navio2 wiki <https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/>`_: Specifically about the Navio2. Sometimes confusing. The `forums <https://community.emlid.com/>`_ are rather responsive.

Shops
=====

There are a lot of shops to get spare parts. Here are some of more popular ones, and comments for each one:

  - `Hobbyking <http://www.hobbyking.com>`_: Cheapest of them all. Has a number of different warehouses around the world. If you wait long enough while looking at a product, they may suggest an even lower price (with a warning that it won't appear again -- it will).
  - `Altigator <https://drones.altigator.com/>`_: Rather expensive, but based in Belgium so shipping is cheaper/faster.
  - `MHM Modellbau <http://www.mhm-modellbau.de/>`_: Random shop in Germany, where the frame and landing gear is bought.

Apart from this, Raspberry Pi's and Navio stuff is bought from the usual places.
